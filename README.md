# Pi Digibox EPG Concept
This is a mockup of the EPG software that will be used on the Pi Digibox, @OldDigibox's Raspberry Pi-based DVB-T receiver in HTML5,
based on the Sky Web EPG. When Phoenix feels this is complete, in collaboration with @OldDigibox, this will be ported to a program
for Linux Raspbian (now known as Raspberry Pi OS) and will be able to tune in to Live TV with interactive teletext features supported.
